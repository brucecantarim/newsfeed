# newsfeed
A simple RSS Newsfeed App using Angular 2 and Ionic 2, built for learning purposes.

I've been following the Tableless tutorial by Carlos Cabral, available at this link:

I highly reccomend it!

## To do challenges:

- Read and implement Virtual Scroll;
- Include the publishing date of the post in the list;
- Include multiple screen navigation with the NavController;
- Implement an option to show subreddits results;
- Think about what to do when the user loses internet connection;
- Use somekind of native smartphone resource (camera?);
